# CelsiusConverterGUI

This project explored the basics of creating a GUI for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit using IntelliJ IDEA Swing UI Designer GUI Form.

Experimented with resizing the JPanel, getting elements on two rows and same column to match in size, surrounding elements in two rows and same column with a JPanel. 

Used JButton, JTextField, JLabel, and ActionListener to create the GUI along with writing boilerplate code that wasn't provided by default in IntelliJ IDEA such as setting up the JFrame, .setSize(), .setVisible in the main method and 
```java
this.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
this.setContentPane(mainPanel);
this.pack() 
```

in the constructor.
